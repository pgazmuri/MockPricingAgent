Mock Drug Pricing Agent - OpenAI Assistant API Demonstration

This application demonstrates how to use the OpenAI Assistant API with function calling
to create a conversational drug pricing agent for a Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM).

The agent helps customers:
1. Find the right drug by searching NDC database
2. Disambiguate between multiple drug options
3. Check eligibility and plan benefits
4. Calculate accurate pricing with discounts and coupons

Key features demonstrated:
- OpenAI Assistant API with function calling
- Natural conversation flow
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Mock services using OpenAI Completions API

Available commands:
‚Ä¢ Type any drug name to search for pricing (e.g., "metformin", "Lipitor")
‚Ä¢ Ask questions like "What will my Advil cost?" or "How much is generic Nexium?"
‚Ä¢ Provide member ID when asked for eligibility checking
‚Ä¢ Type 'help' to see this message again
‚Ä¢ Type 'quit' or 'exit' to end the session
‚Ä¢ Type 'history' to see conversation history

Example interactions:
- "I need pricing for metformin"
- "What's my copay for Lipitor 20mg?"
- "My member ID is ABC123456"
- "How much will 90 days of atorvastatin cost?"

The assistant will automatically:
1. Find your specific drug from multiple options
2. Check your eligibility and plan benefits
3. Look up your year-to-date spending progress
4. Calculate exact pricing with all discounts
5. Show you the complete cost breakdown

üîß Advanced Function Calling Features:

This demo shows how the OpenAI Assistant API orchestrates multiple services
to calculate accurate drug pricing, just like a real PBM system:

1. üìã NDC Lookup - Search drug database and handle multiple matches
2. ‚úÖ Eligibility Check - Verify member coverage and get basic info
3. üìä Plan Benefits - Get detailed tier structure and benefit limits
4. üìà Member Utilization - Check year-to-date spending and deductible progress
5. üíä Formulary Check - Verify drug coverage and tier placement
6. üí∞ Drug Costs - Get wholesale and plan negotiated pricing
7. üé´ Coupon Check - Find available manufacturer discounts
8. üßÆ Pricing Calculator - Perform complex mathematical calculations

The assistant automatically determines which services to call and in what order,
then uses a mathematical calculator to ensure accurate pricing calculations!

Watch for function call indicators (üîß) showing the step-by-step process!
